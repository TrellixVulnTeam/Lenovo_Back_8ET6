    python interpreter that is the program that knows how to translate or interpret our python code into instructions
    that computer can understand.

     program exercises:
18:00           program exercise on hospital patient(new or existing patient).
22:00           program exercise on favorite colour on input function
28:05           ask user to weight and convert into kilograms to terminal.
1:05:10         buy a house with good credit
1:39:00         car program 2 times start and stop solve this
1:52:00         exercise related to Nested Loop
1:59:40         write a program to find the largest number in the list
2:12:08         write a program to remove duplicates in list
2:23:49         exercise on dictionary enter phone numbers returns words.
3:41:39         Roll a Dice.

18:51 input,print are both general purpose functions that are built into python.(for print messages and receiving input)
43:07 len is also function to count number of characters in string
        but it is particular to some string specific function that's why it is method.

20:33 expression is piece of code that produces a value.

37:45 formatted strings are particularly useful in situations.
       where we want to dynamically generate some text with our variable.


47:42 find method vs in operator
        find method returns the index of that character or sequence of the characters
        in operator produces  a boolean value.


56:17 A module in python is a separate file with some reusable code.
        Math module which contains a bunch of reusable functions for performing mathematical calculations.

        Math is an object like string so we can access its functions or more accurately.

    Math module is different from python 2 to python 3.
    in google search like this math module python 3.
    (ceil copysign fabs factorial floor fmod etc)



1:20:15 While Loops
        use while loops to execute block of code multiple times.often useful in interactive programs.
        in future he shows how to build a simple game using while loop.

         write while statement and after that type condition followed by colon as long as this condition is true
         the code that we write in this block repeatedly executed.

        always use meaningful and descriptive names for your variables.

1:41:00
            # we use while loops to execute block of code multiple times.
             #  we use for loop to iterate over a collection such as string.
            # string is sequence of characters so its look like collection.
             # we use for loop to iterate over a each character in a string and then do something with it.

1:46:00
        collection can be a string it can be list it can be range object that is returned from the range object.


2:09:30   actually in operator is used check existence of character  or sequence of characters in string.
            index will return error if number not exist but in operator does not give error.gives boolean value.

#       29  TUPLES(Immutable)               2:13:25

# like list but we cannot modify, add new items, remove existing items

#   count---to count the number of occurrences in an item.
#   index---to find the index of the first occurrences of an item.
#   so we can only get info about tuple. we cannot change it ok got it.
#   we cannot mutate or change the tuple they are immutable.

2:30:49
        we need to break our code into smaller more manageable and more maintainable chunks called FUNCTIONS.

        it is container for few lines of code that performs a specific task.

2:38:23 parameters vs arguments(both are not same okay)
        parameters are holes or placeholders that we define in our function for receiving information.
         arguments are actual pieces of information that we supply to these functions.

2:42:50 most of the cases use position arguments.
        keyword arguments help us improve the readability of the code.
        when u pass numerical values to them use keyword arguments because it will improve readablity of u r program.
        always pass keyword arguments after the positional arguments otherwise u get an error.
        if u pass mix parameters first positional and next keyword arguments.

# 36 Return Statement   2:45:00

        # how to create functions that returns values.
        # this case is useful when if we are doing some kind of calculation and you want to return the result
        # to whoever is using your function.
        # by default all functions return the  value none.
          so if u don't have return statement here by default python returns none.

        #None represents the absence of value.
        # when use return statement in function then u have to call the function with the help of print
        # otherwise directly call the function without print.
        # Each function should be response for one and only task and the task clearly explained in the name of the function.

#  38 Exceptions       2:53:54

        # how to handle errors in python program
        # exit code 0 means our code executes successfully no errors.
        # exit code 1 means our program crashes.
        #  exception is kind of error that crashes our program.

#       44 PACKAGES         3:30:28

        # packages are another way to organise our code.
        # if a project folder contains many modules or files it will be bloated.
        # so better approach is organize related modules inside of a package so package is container
        # for multiple modules. in a file system package is a directory or folder.
        # packages are mostly used in DJANGO framework web application(3:36:20)


#how to create and use packages in python   3:31:29

#               create a new folder called new directory to make it package we need to add special file in it.
#                that is called __init__.py when python sees this file it treated as package.

# randomly pick an item from list we have powerful method.
# example we have team members and you want to randomly pick someone as the leader.  random.choice()
# when you want to return python from function you dont have to add this paranthesis in tuple case
# pep python enhancement proposal(3:44:09) pep8 all the best practice for formatting our code.


#       47 PYPY & PIP           3:50:47

# pypi-Python Package Index(in this directory you can find packages for doing awesome things)
# search pypi.com for community packages
# weeb scraping- you build an engine and have that engine browse a website and extract info from HTML files.
# same technique that google does to index various websites.
#so they have several engines or web crawlers are looking at various websites and extract info from their pages.
# browser automation also we can see here.
#becuase u can automate the testing of your application
# how to install packages from pypi.org.
# open google->pypi.org->openpyxl(in search box->package use for working with excel spreadsheets)
#pip install openpyxl in terminal in your python and check for path external libraries k
